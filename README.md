# Python code for apportionment
This Python code was created for my TDK work called "The American apportionment system and its adaptation to the European Union". In this folder, six Python files can be found. They can be used for apportionment:
 - **arithmetic.py**: apportionment using the method of the arithmetic mean
 - **harmonic.py**: apportionment using the method of the harmonic mean
 - **huntington.py**: apportionment using the method of the geometric mean (also referred to as the Huntington method or the method of equal proportions)
 - **arithmetic_eu.py**: apportionment using the method of the arithmetic mean while respecting degressive proportionality
 - **harmonic_eu.py**: apportionment using the method of the harmonic mean while respecting degressive proportionality
 - **huntington_eu.py**: apportionment using the method of the geometric mean while respecting degressive proportionality
